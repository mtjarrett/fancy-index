1. Clone `fancy-index` repo into /var/www/html or sub directory as desired (instructions will assume this directory).

2. Move `images`, `thumbnailer.py`, and `.htaccess` up one level (/var/www/html).

3. Edit /etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf so that every line is commented out.

4. Edit /etc/httpd/conf.d/userdir.conf so that the final lines read:
<Directory "/var/www/html">
    AllowOverride All
    Options MultiViews Indexes FollowSymLinks
    Require all granted
</Directory>

5. Restart httpd

6. Run /var/www/html/thumbnailer.py so that thumbnails in `images` will appear.

7a. Create cron job to run /var/www/html/thumbnailer.py.
7b. Manually run /var/www/html/thumbnailer.py after each change to `images` directory.

8. Drink all the beer!
